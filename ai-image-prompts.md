## Tips for Better Results

1. **Aspect Ratio**: Generate images with a 4:3 aspect ratio to match your game's layout
2. **Consistency**: Try to maintain a consistent visual style across all images
3. **Italian Elements**: Include subtle Italian elements like the flag colors (green, white, red) when possible
4. **Text**: Avoid generating images with text as AI often creates gibberish text
5. **Quality**: Request high-resolution images (1024×768 or higher) for better quality in your game

## After Generating Images

1. Download all generated images
2. Rename them according to the filenames listed above (e.g., "rome.jpg", "cafe.jpg")
3. Place them in your project's `public/images` folder
4. Restart your development server to see the new images in your game

## Alternative Approach

If you prefer not to use AI image generation, consider using stock photos from websites like Unsplash, Pexels, or Adobe Stock that offer high-quality images of Italian scenes and locations.
